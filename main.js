  // Call the pre-written `updatePlayerDamageText` function with that player damage done.



  // Decrease that monster's hit points by the player damage done variable.


  // Now that we've hurt our monster, here's where the real "game logic" will go.

  // If the monster's hit points are at or below zero now, switch to the next monster, and call our pre-written `updateResult` function with a message that that monster is dead.

  // If we're all out of monsters, call `updateResult` with a message that the player won, and call our pre-written `reset` function to start the game over.

  // Now, if the monster's NOT dead, he gets to attack. (We're letting the player strike first every round, though there are various other ways to do it!) Get a random monster attack damage by calling `getAttackDamage` based on the monster's minimum and maximum attack. THen call `updateMonsterDamageText` with that damage, deduct the damage from the player's hitPoints property, and check if the player's `hitPoints` are now at or below 0.

  // If they are, call `updateResult` with some kind of game over message. Otherwise, `updateResult` to be some kind of generic "You're fighting!" message.

  // No matter what, happens, call `updateHealthIndicators`, which will take care of updating the dom with the result of all of this!
