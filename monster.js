// Make a function called `newMonster` that takes in a number and returns a new object with:
function newMonster (num) {
    let monsterStats = {
        // * a `hitPoints` property set to a number of your choice
        hitPoints: 100,
        // * a minimum attack based in some way on the number that gets passed in, and
        minAttack: 5,
        // * a maximum attack that's based on the that as well (but bigger than the minimum attack.)
        maxAttack: 15,
    }
    // The idea here is that we can get back a monster with a certain "level" that's based on what we pass in, and we can set a minimum and maximum attack to randomize things within a certain range.
